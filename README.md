# **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment (**TDD**)

**T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment (**TDD**)
in Typescript for people who want to write _**more reliable code**_.
</div>

## Why?

_Project(s) without tests_ often end up looking like they are stuck together with _**duct tape**_ ...

Change _one_ part and _another_ stops working? "_Fixing_" one bug, creates another?

Wouldn't you *prefer* it if everything was
***consistent*** and beautifully integrated? <br />
What if _everyone_ on your team worked _like **clock-work**_ in a disciplined order... like a _**Formula 1 Crew**_ ...

Test Driven Development (TDD) makes your team a well-oiled machine which means you can go _**faster**_.

Once you have a ***suite*** of tests that run on every change, you will
begin to develop a whole other level of ***confidence*** in your codebase
and will discover a new freedom to be ***creative*** without fear of
"*breaking*" anything unexpectedly; truly *game-changing*.

### What is TDD?

> Test-driven development (TDD) is an evolutionary approach to development
which combines test-first development, where you write a test before you write
just enough production code to fulfil that test, and refactoring. In other words,
itâ€™s one way to think through your requirements
or design before you write your functional code.

*From [Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html)*

## How?

The *first* thing you need to *understand*
is that writing code following TDD (*discipline*)
is a (*slightly*) different approach from simply
diving into solving the problem (*without a test*).

When reading about TDD you will usually see the expression:
"***Red, Green, Refactor***":

![TDD Cycle: Red, Green, Refactor](https://i.imgur.com/RQe2NQT.jpg)

What this means is that TDD follows a **3-step process**:

1. ***Write a Failing Test*** - Understand the (user)
requirements/story well enough to write a test for what you expect.
(_the test should **fail** initially - hence it being "Red"_)

2. ***Make the (failing) Test Pass*** - Write (*only*) the code you need
to make the (*failing*) test pass, while ensuring your existing/previous tests
all still pass (*no regressions*).

3. ***Refactor the code you wrote*** take the time to tidy up the code
*you* wrote to make it simpler
(*for your future self or colleagues to understand*)
before you need to ship the current feature, do it.

> Thankfully, because you will have good tests,
you don't _need_ to do any refactoring up-front,
you can always do refactoring _later_
if performance bottlenecks are discovered.
Most programming languages have very efficient compilers/interpreters
that remove much of the need for refactoring.
And if you use a linter your code will be naturally "tidy".

To develop the *habit(s)* you will need to be successful with TDD
(*and software engineering in general*)
we need to ***write*** a ***test first*** (*and watch it fail*)
and *then* write the code required to make the test pass.

Writing a _**failing test**_,
before writing the code may seem *counter-intuitive*,
*time consuming* or even "*tedious*" at _**first**_.
But we _urge_ you to think of it this way:

> The ***test*** is the ***question*** you are asking <br />
> your code is the ***answer*** to the question. <br />
> By having a _clear_ question, you can always check
> that your code is working, <br />
> because it _**consistently**_
> gives you the same answer(s) ... _no surprises_,
even when you're working with a large, inter-dependent code base!

## Setup the project 
- clone the repo 
- yarn or npm install 

## Running tests 
- yarn test --watch
